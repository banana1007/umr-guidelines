UMR Zoom meeting summary 12/17/2018

Participants: Bill, Martha, James P, Tim, Jeff, Yuchen, Jayeol, Meagan, Sara, Bert

Meeting summary:

We reviewed a few sentences from LORELEI_NW_AFP_ENG_0024_20060217_28amrs.txt and discussed temporal and modality annotation:

Bill raised the issue of how to annotate modality as relations on AMR graphs, and we discussed how this might be done on 
a couple of examples.

Martha suggested it is useful to do RED annotation on these examples and see which aspect of RED annotation can be adopted 
on UMR annotation.

Bert raised the possibility of annotating tense as relations on AMR graphs, and suggested that the :time attribute on AMR
graphs can be replaced with TimeML style temporal relations to abstract away from cross-linguistic variations. In addition, 
semantic tense can also be annotated in the same manner, as a temporal relation between an event and the document creation 
time (or Now). It is also proposed as a way to avoid tense annotation on events, and the temporal location of some events
are better expressed as relation between the event and some reference event.

Tim raised the issue of modified temporal relations with this approach (e.g., one day before ...), but suggested that this
can be addressed by reifying such relations as concepts.

Bill raised the issue of how to decide which events should be annotated as a relation between the event and DCT (i.e., semantic
tense), and which events should be annotated in relation with respect to other events. We agreed this is the central issue
if such an approach is feasible.

Next Meeting: Jan 9, 2019 with Johan Bos.
In prepartion for the meeting, we need to prepare a list of topics to discuss with Google Doc. Bert will create the Google
Doc.
